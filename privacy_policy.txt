1. Information We Collect

Law Resources does not directly collect any personal information from its users. However, our app uses AdMob, a third-party advertising service provided by Google, to display ads within the app. AdMob may collect information to serve personalized ads and improve the quality of the ads shown to you.

2. AdMob and Third-Party Advertising

AdMob, as a third-party service, may collect information about your device, including unique device identifiers, IP address, and mobile network information. This information may be used to display personalized ads based on your interests, browsing habits, and app usage patterns.

AdMob may also use cookies or similar technologies to track your interaction with the ads displayed within the app. This data helps AdMob analyze the effectiveness of the ads and deliver more relevant ads to you.

Please note that opting out of personalized ads does not prevent the display of ads within the app; it only affects the personalization of the ads shown.
